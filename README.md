# Vanuatu Energy Dashboard

An app to display Vanuatu's energy costs and sources as a Dash app.
All data from publicly available sources.

## Development Notes

TODO:
- Scrape Unelco's electricity costs breakdowns per month
- Automate fetching WTI records

Stretch Ideas:
- Enter an electricity usage figure and calculate amount at different times in history
- Track power cuts in Port Vila

## Notes

Apparently WTI crude oil price per barrel in USD + 32 USD equals price in VUV (before tax) in 10 weeks.
